    <h1>About Me: Christian Baez</h1>
    <p>My name is Christian Baez, Im 16yo and a student at Staten Island Tech and I live in and was born in Staten Island. My hobbies include Writing and Sprite Art.
       My brother recently graduated from Monsignor Farrell and is now starting his first year in NYU. Recently i've been trying to learn coding to learn
       how to make Terraria/Balatro mods, I also recently learned how to use the Hammer Editor(Map Maker for TF2 and Other Valve Games). Over the summer I
       started writing a story I had forgotten about a while ago but decided to come back to and I have a decent bit more done than I had before. Some fun facts about me are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I am a green belt in karate</li>
      <li>My sister has 4 cats</li>
      <li>I've never broken a bone</li>
      <li>I'm distantly related to The Rizzler</li>
    </ul>
